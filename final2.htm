<h1>My Pets</h1>
<h2 class = "clear">Charlie</h2>
<img src = "charlie.jpg" alt = "Charlie" title = "Charlie" class = "left">
<p> Charlie is my first dog. It took years to convince my dad to get one. We got him as a puppy in August of 2018. He can be a little turd sometimes, but we all love him anyways. He is a mixed breed: Pomeranian, German Shepherd, Alaskan Klee Kai and Shiba Inu. He loves to eat anything and will jump and snatch food off your plate in order to get what he wants.</p>

<h2 class = "clear">Wally</h2>
<img src = "walter.jpg" alt = "Wally" title = "Wally" class = "left">
<p> Wally was being given away by someone on Facebook. He was a total surprise. I came home from work one night and my parents had went and picked him up. He loves to cuddle and loves everyone. He is around 3 years old and is a mixed breed as well: Pomeranian, Bichon Frise and Pekingese. He loves to chase birds and bark at anyone who walks past our house. He would make a great guard dog! </p>

<h2 class = "clear">Oreo</h2>
<img src = "Oreo.jpg" alt = "Oreo" title = "Oreo" class = "left">
<p> Oreo is the sweetest cat ever. She is around 15 years old. She is always purring and will sit with you. She was a stray living under our deck for around 2 years before we finally able to catch her. While living in our backyard, she had 3 litters of kittens, all of which we were able to catch once they were old enough and find them homes. Once she was captured, she had a fourth litter in our house...with 6 kittens! </p>

<h2 class = "clear">Trixie</h2>
<img src = "trixie.jpg" alt = "Trixie" title = "Trixie" class = "left">
<p> Trixie is still a little kitten, 3 months old. We have had her for only a few weeks. She loves people and attention and will do anything to get it, even it means jumping on the kitchen table. She also enjoys pestering and playing with the dogs. She surprisingly doesn't get along with Oreo, which makes me feel bad for her. </p>

<h2 class = "clear">Kookie</h2>
<img src = "kookie.png" alt = "Kookie" title = "Kookie" class = "left">
<p> Kookie is my hedgehog. Unlike the other pets, I have full responsibility of Kookie. I got her in September of this year and she is now 3 months old. She is my third hedgehog. She has characteristics of my previous hedgehogs: Pepper's personality and Chubbs' looks/messiness. She is a sweetheart and loves to run on her wheel and sleep. As you can see on there picture, she has one pink ear and one gray ear, she is so cute! </p>

<h1 class = "clear">In Memory Of</h1>
<h2 class = "clear">Pepper</h2>
<img src = "pepper2.jpg" alt = "Pepper" title = "Pepper" class = "left">
<p id = "pepper">Pepper was my first pet who I took care of myself. She was the sweetest pet I have ever had. She sadly passed away one and a half years ago, the night before my birthday. She was four years old, which is a pretty average lifespan for a hedgehog. I would bring her everywhere I went: on the couch, to the dinner table. I even was able to bring her to my high school speech class and take her with me to do my senior pictures. She loved to run on her wheel and sleep in her sleeping pouch. I still miss her lots and wish I had more time with her.  </p>

<h2 class = "clear">Chubbs</h2>
<img src = "chubbs.jpg" alt = "Chubbs" title = "Chubbs" class = "left">
<p> Chubbs was my second hedgehog. I adopted him from the animal shelter in 2019 and was told he was a year old at the time. He was a big hedgehog, almost double of the other two I have had. He loved to eat and sleep.. just like me! He was really scared and didn't like people. He was definitely neglected before I got him. His nails were super long and curled and he was missing his tail. In his last moments, he finally got friendlier and snuggled with me. It broke my heart that I only had a couple years with him. I really miss him. </p>
